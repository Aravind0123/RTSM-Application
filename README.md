# RTSM Application

This RTSM (Randomization and Trial Supply Management) application streamlines **patient enrollment, randomization**, and **trial supply management** for clinical trials.

-----

## Setting Up the Application

Follow these steps to get the RTSM application up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

  * **Git:** To download the project from GitHub.
  * **VS Code (or any preferred IDE):** For editing and running Python and JavaScript files.
  * **MySQL:** For database management.
  * **Node.js:** For running the frontend (JavaScript).

### Backend Setup (Python & Flask)

1.  **Download the Project:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aravind0123/RTSM-Application.git
    ```
2.  **Database Configuration:**
      * Navigate to the `backend` folder within the downloaded project.
      * Open `db.py`.
      * Update the database connection details (`username`, `password`, and `database name`) to match your MySQL setup.
3.  **Initialize Database Tables:**
      * Open a terminal in VS Code (or your chosen IDE).
      * Navigate to the `backend` folder.
      * Run the following command to set up the necessary database tables:
        ```bash
        python table_setup.py
        ```
4.  **Populate Initial Data:**
      * Run this command to populate initial data, such as system configurations:
        ```bash
        python packs.py
        ```
5.  **Start the Backend Server:**
      * Finally, run the backend Flask application:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```

### Frontend Setup (React.js)

1.  **Install Node.js:** If you haven't already, install Node.js (which includes npm).
2.  **Navigate to Frontend:**
      * Open a new terminal.
      * Navigate to the root of your downloaded project folder (e.g., `RTSM-Application`).
3.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
      * Run the following command to start the React development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    This will open the application in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

The RTSM application uses a role-based access system. Here's a general workflow:

1.  **Admin Login:**
      * Access the application in your browser.
      * Login using the default **Admin** credentials:
          * **Username:** `Admin`
          * **Password:** `Admin`
2.  **Admin Panel Actions:**
      * As an Admin, you can **generate secret codes** for `Investigator`, `Monitor`, and `Depot` users.
      * You can also **generate and manage sites** within the RTSM admin panel.
      * **Note:** The generated secret codes can be viewed directly in your MySQL database for reference.
3.  **User Registration & Login (Investigator, Monitor, Depot):**
      * Click on **"Register"**.
      * Enter your desired `username` and `password`.
      * Crucially, enter the **secret code** obtained from the Admin panel (or directly from the MySQL database).
      * Select the **site** that was generated by the RTSM Admin and assigned to your role.
      * Once registered, you can log in with your new credentials.
4.  **Role-Specific Actions:**
      * **Investigator:** Can perform actions such as **patient enrollment, screen failure, randomization, treatment completion, emergency code break**, and record **medical arrival**.
      * **Monitor:** Can perform **emergency code breaks** and **view all patient statuses** for their specific site.
      * **Depot User:** Can **raise consignments** of trial supplies from the depot to various sites.
